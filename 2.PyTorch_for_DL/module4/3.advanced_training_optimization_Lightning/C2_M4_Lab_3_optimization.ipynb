    "# Advanced Training Optimization using Lightning\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team has been tasked with optimizing the memory footprint of your deep learning models. With GPU memory being one of the most expensive resources in your infrastructure budget, your manager has requested solutions to reduce peak memory usage without compromising model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab guides you through implementing and evaluating two powerful memory optimization techniques: **Mixed Precision Training** and **Gradient Accumulation**. These methods can significantly reduce GPU memory consumption while maintaining model accuracy, potentially leading to substantial cost savings in your ML infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the optimizations themselves, this notebook will deepen your understanding of the Lightning framework. You will see how to use core components like the `Trainer` and `Callbacks` to structure and control your training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have built a complete framework to:\n",
    "* **Build a custom `Callback`** to reliably measure key performance metrics like peak GPU memory and validation accuracy.\n",
    "* **Encapsulate the core training logic** by configuring the Lightning `Trainer` with memory-efficient parameters.\n",
    "* **Systematically benchmark** the different techniques against a baseline to gather empirical data.\n",
    "* **Analyze the trade-offs** between memory usage and model performance to make data-driven decisions."

    "#### Combining Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next run, you will combine mixed precision and gradient accumulation. This is a powerful approach where you use both techniques at the same time to create a highly efficient training configuration. The goal is to see if you can get the synergistic benefits of both working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should consider this combined strategy when you are facing significant constraints in GPU memory. It is especially useful for training very large, state of the art models that require a large batch size for stable convergence but are too big to fit in memory using standard precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benefit is achieving maximum resource efficiency. Mixed precision reduces the memory footprint and speeds up computation, while gradient accumulation allows you to train with a stable, large effective batch size. The potential drawback is that the risks of each technique are combined. You must be mindful of a potential accuracy dip from mixed precision alongside the possibility of longer training times from gradient accumulation. As always, benchmarking is essential to confirm this combination yields the best overall result for your specific model and goal.\n",

The results from your experiments demonstrate how to effectively reduce peak memory usage (infrastructure costs) while maintaining model performance. \n",

    "You now have a practical, data-driven approach for making cost-effective decisions about model training. By systematically benchmarking different strategies, you can ensure you are making the most efficient use of your GPU memory budget—an essential skill for managing infrastructure costs while scaling your work to larger models and datasets."
