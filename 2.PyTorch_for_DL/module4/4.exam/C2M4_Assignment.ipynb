    "# Programming Assignment: A Pneumonia Diagnostic Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on developing a strong skill set in PyTorch and Lightning! You have learned how to construct neural networks and optimize training pipelines. This assignment is your opportunity to channel that expertise into a project with real world significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true power of artificial intelligence is demonstrated when it is applied to solve complex, meaningful problems. In this assignment, you will begin your journey into the impactful field of medical AI by building a tool to assist clinicians with pneumonia diagnosis. Your mission is to engineer the core deep learning engine for an AI powered diagnostic assistant. This is a direct application of the professional grade skills you have been developing, challenging you to build a solution that is not only accurate but also robust and well structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this programming assignment, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assemble a `LightningDataModule` to create a clean and reusable data pipeline.\n",
    "* Build a `LightningModule` to encapsulate your model, loss function, and training logic.\n",
    "* Configure a Lightning `Trainer` with callbacks to run an efficient training loop.\n",
    "* Evaluate your model's performance to understand its predictive capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will develop a model that can analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as **Normal**, **Bacterial Pneumonia**, or **Viral Pneumonia**. This classification is an essential task, as a quick and accurate diagnosis can lead to better patient outcomes."

    "## 1 - Chest X-Ray Images\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective medical AI model is built upon a foundation of high-quality, relevant data. For your assignment, you will work with the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia), a valuable collection of medical imagery. This dataset consists of chest X-ray images sourced from retrospective studies of pediatric patients aged one to five years at the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center. To ensure diagnostic quality, every image was evaluated and graded by two medical experts before its inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='1-1'></a>\n",
    "### 1.1 - Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "To tailor the data for your diagnostic tool, a few important modifications were made. The original dataset was organized into `train`, `test`, and `val` folders. To streamline the evaluation process, the `test` and `val` sets were combined into a single validation set for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, this assignment presents you with a nuanced, multiclass problem. The original dataset only identified images as `NORMAL` or `PNEUMONIA`. In the version you will use, the `PNEUMONIA` class has been split into two distinct categories: `BACTERIAL_PNEUMONIA` and `VIRAL_PNEUMONIA`. This change provides a more detailed diagnostic task, allowing your model to learn the subtle differences between the two types of infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, preventing model bias is an essential part of building a fair and reliable medical tool. For that reason, the dataset was **balanced**. Images from the more frequent classes were randomly removed until every class in the training and validation sets contained the exact same number of images.\n",

    "**How the Model Was Trained**\n",

    "**Why a Two-Stage Strategy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original ResNet-18 model was trained on general images (like photos of cats, dogs, and cars), not medical scans. While its core layers are excellent at detecting basic shapes and textures, they need to be adapted for the specific patterns found in X-rays. This two-stage approach provides a much faster turnaround with limited resources compared to training the entire model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Extraction**: First, only the new classifier head was trained for **10 epochs** with a learning rate of **1e-3**. This quickly teaches the final layer to make predictions based on the general features from the frozen ResNet backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine-Tuning**: Simply training the classifier head isn't always enough. In this stage, the **last two convolutional blocks** (`layer3` and `layer4`) of the ResNet model were \"unfrozen\" and the entire model was trained for another **15 epochs** with a much smaller learning rate of **1e-5**. This carefully adjusts the pre-trained layers to become better at identifying pneumonia-specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this two-stage process, the model achieved a final validation accuracy of approximately **80%**.\n",
    "\n",
