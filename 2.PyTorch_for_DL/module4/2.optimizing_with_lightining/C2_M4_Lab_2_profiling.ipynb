    "\n",
    "When working with PyTorch, you often spend significant time writing boilerplate code for training loops, data handling, and device management. This repetitive work can distract you from the main goal: designing and training your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **[Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) (formerly PyTorch Lightning)** comes in. It is a high level framework that organizes your PyTorch code and automates the engineering, letting you focus on the research. This lab will introduce you to Lightning's structure and show you how it simplifies advanced tasks like performance tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also be introduced to **Profiling**, a technique used to analyze your code's performance and find \"bottlenecks\" that slow down your training. By the end of this lab, you will have used Lightning to diagnose and fix a real performance issue, giving you a complete workflow for building more efficient models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organize standard PyTorch code into Lightning's `LightningDataModule` and `LightningModule`.\n",
    "* Run a training loop to establish a baseline for speed and accuracy.\n",
    "* Use the integrated Profiler to diagnose a \"model complexity\" bottleneck.\n",
    "* Verify your fix by profiling a more efficient model and comparing the results.\n",
    "* Evaluate the final trade-off between training speed and model performance."

    "## Defining the Data and Model with Lightning\n",
    "\n",
    "With your environment set up, it's time to structure the core components of your project. Lightning provides an organized approach by separating data-handling from model logic. You'll define these in the next two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Simplifying Data Loading with the `LightningDataModule`\n",
    "\n",
    "In your previous work with PyTorch, you have seen the standard data pipeline: you define a `Dataset` and then wrap it in a `DataLoader`. This often requires you to manage separate `DataLoader` instances for your training and validation sets, which can scatter your data-handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightning simplifies and organizes this entire process by encapsulating all data-related logic into a single, reusable class called a <code>[LightningDataModule](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html)</code>. This class becomes the central hub for sourcing, preparing, and delivering your data, which keeps your main training script clean and focused on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the `CIFAR10DataModule` class by implementing these essential methods:\n",
    "    * **`__init__`**: The constructor where you define specifications for your data pipeline, such as `batch_size`, `num_workers`, and data `transforms`.\n",
    "    * **`prepare_data()`**: This method handles initial, one time setup like downloading the dataset. Lightning ensures this only happens on a single process to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "        * For this class, this method will check if the **CIFAR10** dataset is present and download it if not.\n",
    "    * **`setup()`**: Prepares the data for use by creating your training and validation `Dataset` splits. The `stage` argument *could* be used to set up different data for different stages (e.g., `'fit'`, `'validate'`, `'test'`). However, in this case, the setup is the same for all stages and, by default, prepares the data needed for the `'fit'` stage.\n",
    "        * Think of the **'fit'** stage as the combined training and validation loop. The **'test'** or **'validate'** stages are similar to a standalone evaluation phase in standard PyTorch.\n",
    "    * **`train_dataloader()` & `val_dataloader()`**: These methods return the familiar PyTorch `DataLoader` instances, configured with essential performance settings."

    "Great work! You have successfully run a full training loop using the organized structure of Lightning. Now, reflect on that process. Did you notice the total training time? For a classic and relatively small dataset like **CIFAR-10**, it might have felt slower than you would hope. This experience leads you to an essential question every machine learning practitioner must ask: Why did it take that long, and can you achieve similar results more efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the answer, you will need to investigate the potential causes. A common culprit for slow training is the model itself. This naturally leads you to question your specific architecture and ask:\n",

    "> Is This Model Too Complex for the Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this, take a closer look at your baseline model's architecture. By default, it's configured with:\n",

    "* Convolutional channels: `(256, 512, 1024)`\n",
    "* Linear features: `2048`\n",

    "Profiling is the process of analyzing your code to get a detailed breakdown of where it spends the most time and resources, like CPU cycles, GPU time, and memory. This analysis is the key to confirming your hypothesis about the model's complexity and finding any performance **bottlenecks**, the specific parts of your code that are disproportionately slow.\n",

    "#### Analyzing the Improvement: The Impact of Simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison table clearly shows a significant performance gain from simplifying the model's architecture. The most important change is the dramatic reduction in the overall `ProfilerStep*` time, meaning the simpler model completes a training step much faster. This speed-up comes directly from reducing the time spent on core computational kernels like `aten::conv2d` and their backward passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates a key lesson in model optimization: **your architecture should match your dataset's complexity**. For a simple dataset like CIFAR-10, a smaller model is more efficient, allowing you to train faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Note on the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "You might find it interesting that while the overall `ProfilerStep*` time dropped significantly, the time for individual kernels like `aten::conv2d` or `aten::convolution_backward` changed only slightly, and may in some cases have even increased. This is not an error; it highlights how performance bottlenecks work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Before (Complex Model)**: The model had very large tensors (e.g., `1024` channels). Handling these large shapes adds a lot of overhead in memory management and framework logic *around* the core calculations. The GPU might even be underutilized if the overhead of preparing these large tensors causes small delays between operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **After (Simple Model)**: The core math for a single convolution doesn't fundamentally change, but the tensors it operates on are much smaller (e.g., `128` channels). The massive speed-up comes from the reduced overhead. With simpler data shapes to manage, the framework can feed operations to the GPU more efficiently, leading to a much faster total step time even if the time for one specific kernel doesn't change dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, you have removed the **model complexity bottleneck**, allowing the entire pipeline to run much more smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Beyond Model Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that this is just one type of performance issue the profiler can help diagnose. In other scenarios, you might use it to uncover **data loading bottlenecks** (where the GPU is idle waiting for data from the CPU), inefficient memory usage, or other parts of the pipeline that slow down your training. The key is to use the profiler as a versatile tool to form and test hypotheses about any aspect of your code's performance."

    "More importantly, you've learned a practical, data-driven approach to optimization. You started by establishing a baseline, used the **profiler** to form a hypothesis about a performance bottleneck, tested that hypothesis with a second profiling run, and finally, verified that your more efficient model performed equally well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested in exploring the full, granular details, you can download the `.JSON` trace files from the `./profiler_output/` directory and upload them to a trace viewer like the [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev). This provides far more information than the summary table.\n",
