    "# Programming Assignment: AI Powered Request Dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of AI-powered chat and large language models, delivering a great response begins with understanding the user's prompt. Before any system can act, it must first know what is being asked. Is the user asking a question? Do they want to brainstorm ideas? Or are they requesting a summary?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the pivotal challenge you will solve in this assignment. You're going to build an **AI Powered Request Dispatcher**, the essential first step for any advanced AI system. Your model will learn to analyze and classify the intent behind any user request, ensuring it gets routed to the correct specialized tool for a perfect response. Think of it as the smart front door for a powerful AI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will guide you through the entire process, from handling raw data to fine-tuning a sophisticated, pre-trained model. You'll see firsthand how foundational concepts come together to create a practical, real-world tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you'll do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preparing the Data**: You'll start with the **Databricks Dolly 15k dataset**, a high-quality collection of instructions, and preprocess it by consolidating categories and converting them into numerical labels ready for the model.\n",
    "* **Setting Up the Foundation**: You will leverage **DistilBERT**, a fast and powerful pre-trained model, and its tokenizer to serve as the core of your dispatcher.\n",
    "* **Assembling the Data Feed**: You'll construct a custom PyTorch `Dataset` for on-the-fly tokenization and build `DataLoaders` to efficiently batch and serve data to the model during training.\n",
    "* **Optimizing the Fine-Tuning Process**: You'll implement advanced strategies to make your training more effective. This includes calculating **class weights** to handle imbalanced data and using partial freezing for efficient fine-tune training.\n",
    "* **Training and Evaluation**: Finally, you'll bring everything together to train your dispatcher, analyze its performance with a confusion matrix, and test its real-world capabilities on new, unseen instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin building the intelligent core of your next great AI application!"

    "## 1 - The Databricks Dolly 15k Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Every great AI system is built on a foundation of high-quality data. For your **AI Powered Request Dispatcher**, that foundation is the [Databricks Dolly 15k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehilsanyal/databricks-dolly-15k-dataset), an open source, instruction following dataset created by thousands of Databricks employees. It contains over 15,000 high quality prompt and response pairs designed to make language models more helpful and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your task of building a dispatcher, you will focus on two key columns: `instruction`, which contains the user prompt, and `category`, which describes the type of task the instruction represents (e.g., `open_qa`, `summarization`, `creative_writing`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Dataset Was Augmented\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a truly robust dispatcher, you can't just rely on the original data. That's why this dataset has been augmented using a professional technique called **back-translation**. This process created new training examples that are grammatically different but semantically similar to the original ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, each instruction was translated from English into 10 different intermediate languages, such as Arabic, Urdu, and German, and then immediately translated back to English. This process created new sentences with slightly different wording but the same core meaning. These unique variations were then combined with the original data to create a larger and more diverse set of examples for your training, growing the dataset from approximately 15,000 to 26,000 instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in the specifics, you can take a look at the `augment_dataset_with_back_translation` function that was used for it, which can be found in the `helper_utils.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this powerful, augmented dataset in hand, your first mission is to preprocess and shape it into the perfect fuel for your model.\n",
