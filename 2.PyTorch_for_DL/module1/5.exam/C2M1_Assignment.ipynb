    "You are now a seller of authentic digital art and are using the AI Explorer system to assist in reselling available artwork, which includes both real and fake pieces. Your aim is to ensure that the art you resell is authentic by accurately classifying each piece as real (labeled as 1) or fake (labeled as 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, you face two significant risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reputation Issue**: Selling fake art as real, which eventually leads to a loss of reputation or discourages people from buying your art. This can be described as a False Positive (FP) error. Here, the model incorrectly classifies fake art as real, labeling it as 1 when it should be 0.\n",
    "- **Profit Issue**: Not selling real art because you classify it as fake, which leads to a loss of potential profit. This corresponds to a False Negative (FN) error, where real art is incorrectly labeled as fake, assigning it a 0 instead of the correct label 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of your system in terms of both these issues, you can employ metrics like Recall and Precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall** helps ensure real art is correctly identified, minimizing FN errors and increasing the number of available pieces to sell. It is the percentage of actual real art pieces that are correctly classified. Recall values range between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating fewer FN errors, meaning more real art is correctly identified and available for sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision** focuses on correctly identifying fake pieces, reducing FP errors and protecting your reputation. It is the percentage of identified real art pieces that are actually real. Precision also ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1 indicating fewer FP errors, thereby enhancing your credibility by ensuring fake art is not being sold as real.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing your system with these metrics in mind, you can balance maintaining your credibility and maximizing your sales potential."

    "Excellent work, AI Explorer! You have successfully completed your mission to build the FakeFinder, mastering a powerful and modern AutoML workflow from start to finish. You engineered a dynamic `FlexibleCNN`, designed a sophisticated search space with Optuna, and implemented the objective function that guided the automated discovery process. By going beyond simple accuracy to analyze model efficiency with metrics like trainable parameters, precision, and recall, you have learned to balance performance with practical, real world constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you've developed are at the forefront of AI, where automating model discovery is an essential technique for solving complex problems. You are now well equipped with the tools and mindset to build and evaluate models based on specific business goals, a capability that will be invaluable as you tackle even more ambitious challenges. Congratulations on a successful expedition, and best of luck on your next adventure! "
