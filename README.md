## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster package management.

Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

Or if you prefer pip:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Structure

Each module contains labs and assignments with helper utilities and test scripts included.
