    "Creating a highly accurate model is a significant achievement, but for many real-world applications, accuracy alone is not enough. A model must also be **fast, lightweight, and efficient** to run on devices with limited memory or processing power, such as mobile phones. This is where model compression techniques become essential, allowing you to trim down your model without a major loss in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is a powerful compression method that operates on a simple principle: not all parts of a trained network are equally important. Many of the millions of parameters in a large model contribute very little to the final predictions. By systematically removing these less useful connections, you can create a more streamlined and efficient network.\n",

    "This lab provides a hands-on guide to implementing various pruning strategies using PyTorch's `torch.nn.utils.prune` module. Through practical examples, you will learn how to apply these techniques, verify their effects, and make the resulting sparsity permanent in your models. You will explore three fundamental approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unstructured Pruning**: Removing individual weights based on their magnitude, creating a sparse model without altering its architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured Pruning**: Removing entire structural units, such as channels in a convolutional layer or neurons in a linear layer, which can lead to direct speedups.\n",

    "Now that you have explored these pruning techniques in detail, you might be wondering when and in what scenarios each method can be applied effectively in your work. Understanding the strengths and suitable contexts for each technique is crucial to maximizing their benefits in your neural network optimization efforts. Let's delve into some best practices and use cases for unstructured, structured, and global pruning, helping you decide which approach aligns best with your specific needs and goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unstructured Pruning**:\n",
    "    * **Best Practices**: Unstructured pruning is often used when you want to maximize sparsity while maintaining flexibility. It is best suited for models where the architecture should remain unchanged, and you only need to prune less important weights.\n",
    "    * **Use Cases**: This technique is useful in scenarios where hardware support for sparsity is present, allowing the sparsely pruned model to be efficiently executed. It's suitable for environments like server-side deployments where computational resources are relatively abundant but memory savings are crucial.\n",
    "2. **Structured Pruning**:\n",
    "    * **Best Practices**: Use structured pruning when you need to improve inference speed and reduce the model's memory footprint effectively. This technique can significantly accelerate the model since entire structures like channels or neurons are removed.\n",
    "    * **Use Cases**: It's ideal for edge devices or mobile applications where computational resources are limited, as structured pruning can help maintain a balance between model size and accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency.\n",
    "3. **Global Pruning**:\n",
    "    * **Best Practices**: Global pruning is advantageous when aiming for a consistent level of sparsity across multiple layers. It minimizes the risk of over-pruning critical parts of the model by evaluating the importance of weights globally rather than locally.\n",
    "    * **Use Cases**: This approach is beneficial in situations where the overall model performance is more critical than the performance of individual layers. It's particularly effective for creating uniformly sparse models that can adapt to various processing environments without heavily compromising accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding these techniques and their implications, you can tailor your pruning strategy to best fit your application's needs, whether it's speeding up inference, reducing memory usage, or balancing efficiency with accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the optional section below, you'll get a hands-on opportunity to apply one of these techniques in a real-world scenario. Specifically, you will apply global pruning to a pre-trained model and observe the significant before-and-after results, providing a practical demonstration of its impact."

    "## (Optional) Practical Application: Global Pruning and Comparative Analysis of a Pre-trained Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This optional section transitions from theoretical understanding to a hands-on demonstration of model pruning in a more realistic setting. Here, you will observe a practical pipeline for applying **global pruning** to a pre-trained **ResNet18** model. You'll see the impact of global pruning by comparing the performance results and model characteristics of a **pruned** ResNet18 against its **unpruned** counterpart, both trained on the same dataset for the same number of epochs. The goal is to provide a concrete example of how pruning can be integrated into a typical deep learning optimization workflow, **demonstrating that comparable performance can be achieved on a pruned model**, thus showcasing its benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You might be wondering: among the various pruning techniques, why opt for global pruning, especially when working with a powerful pre-trained model like ResNet18?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Global pruning is chosen for this practical application with a pre-trained model like ResNet18 for several strategic reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Consistent Sparsity Across Layers**: Global pruning is advantageous when aiming for a consistent level of sparsity across multiple layers. For a complex, multi-layered pre-trained model, it ensures that pruning is applied holistically, rather than layer by layer in isolation.\n",
    "* **Optimized Resource Allocation**: It minimizes the risk of over-pruning critical parts of the model by evaluating the importance of weights globally rather than locally. This allows the model to intelligently prune more from less sensitive layers and less from more sensitive layers, which is crucial for retaining performance on a pre-trained network.\n",
    "* **Overall Performance Focus**: This approach is beneficial when the overall model performance is more critical than the performance of individual layers. For pre-trained models used in transfer learning, maintaining high overall accuracy after compression is usually paramount.\n",
    "* **Uniformly Sparse Models**: Global pruning is particularly effective for creating uniformly sparse models that can adapt to various processing environments without heavily compromising accuracy. This makes the pruned pre-trained model more versatile for deployment.\n",
    "  \n",
    "While unstructured pruning can maximize sparsity, it relies on hardware support for efficiency, which may not always be available, especially for fine-grained sparsity. Structured pruning, while improving inference speed and reducing memory footprint by removing entire units, might be too aggressive if not carefully managed, potentially leading to a larger accuracy drop on complex pre-trained architectures compared to global pruning's more nuanced approach. Global pruning offers a balanced strategy for optimizing pre-trained models by considering the network's entire weight distribution, making it a highly relevant choice for practical deployment."

While this can lead to faster inference on hardware that supports sparse operations, it doesn't inherently reduce the model's disk footprint or dense memory usage without further steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook provided a practical guide to model pruning with PyTorch. You have seen how to apply different pruning strategies, from removing individual weights with **nstructured pruning** to entire neurons with **structured pruning**. You also explored how to apply these techniques across multiple layers simultaneously using **global pruning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the optional section, you put these concepts into practice by applying global pruning to a pre-trained ResNet18 model. The results demonstrated that you can achieve a massive reduction in a model's effective parameters while maintaining performance comparable to an unpruned baseline. This outcome highlights a vital aspect of model optimization: a model's performance does not always depend on the sheer number of its parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that even after zeroing out half the network, the model's file size did not decrease. This is because standard PyTorch methods save the pruned weights in a dense format, masks and all. While this approach is perfect for understanding pruning's impact, achieving actual size reduction requires additional steps or other compression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills learned here are a foundational step in optimizing deep learning models for deployment. By reducing a model's complexity, you make it more suitable for resource-constrained environments, paving the way for the next step in model compression: **quantization**."
