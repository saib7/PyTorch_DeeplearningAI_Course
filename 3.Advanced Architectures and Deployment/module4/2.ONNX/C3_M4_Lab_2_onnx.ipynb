    "# From PyTorch to ONNX\n",
    "\n",
    "After investing significant effort to train a high-performing model, the next pivotal step is preparing it for deployment. In a real-world setting, your model needs to be efficient and capable of running on various platforms. However, a model is often a set of Python objects that only its native framework, like PyTorch, knows how to execute. This can make it incompatible with environments that cannot run Python or PyTorch directly, such as mobile apps or embedded devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where  **[ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)](https://onnx.ai)** becomes essential. ONNX is an open standard designed to represent machine learning models, enabling them to be used across different frameworks and runtimes. By converting your model to the ONNX format, you make it **portable** and unlock a wide range of deployment possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will walk through the practical steps of this process. You will:\n",
    "* Take a fully trained PyTorch model and export it to the ONNX format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the **ONNX Runtime** to perform inference with the newly converted `.onnx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a further demonstration of ONNX's flexibility, an optional section will also guide you through converting the ONNX model to a TensorFlow representation and running inference with it."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on successfully converting a PyTorch model to the ONNX format and running inference with it!\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this process, you have seen firsthand how to decouple your model from its original training framework. Your model is no longer just a PyTorch artifact; it is now in a standardized format that can be deployed across a multitude of environments that support the ONNX standard. As another practical example, the optional section of this notebook showed you how to take this portability a step further by converting the ONNX model into a TensorFlow representation and running inference with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a key step in preparing your models, making them more versatile and efficient for production environments. You are now equipped with a vital skill for bridging the gap between model development and real-world deployment."
