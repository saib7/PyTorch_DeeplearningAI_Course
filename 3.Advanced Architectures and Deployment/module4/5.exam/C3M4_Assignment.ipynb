        "# Programming Assignment: CleanVision AI - Optimizing Models for Metro City's Smart Fleet\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your Mission: Smart City Cleanup Initiative 🏙️\n",
        "\n",
        "**Welcome to CleanVision AI!**\n",
        "\n",
        "Congratulations on joining CleanVision AI as a Machine Learning Engineer! Our startup has just landed a major contract with the Metro City Council to revolutionize urban waste management. Here's the situation:\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Challenge:**  \n",
        "Metro City wants to deploy AI-powered cameras on their existing fleet of 500 street cleaning vehicles to automatically identify areas that need attention. The city has provided us with a pre-trained ResNet-18 model that accurately classifies street scenes into three categories: *clean*, *litter*, and *recycle*. It works perfectly in the cloud—but there's a catch.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Problem:**  \n",
        "The street cleaning vehicles are equipped with **edge devices** (similar to Raspberry Pi) with:\n",
        "- ❌ No GPU\n",
        "- ❌ Limited RAM (4GB)\n",
        "- ❌ Constrained storage (16GB)\n",
        "- ❌ CPU-only inference capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "The city's budget won't allow for hardware upgrades, and they need real-time inference (< 50ms per image) to make instant routing decisions. Our current model is **512 MB** and takes over **900ms per batch** on CPU—completely unusable for their needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Task:**  \n",
        "The city is expecting a demo in two weeks. Your manager has assigned you to optimize the model for deployment on these edge devices. The model must:\n",
        "1. ✅ Run efficiently on CPU-only hardware\n",
        "2. ✅ Fit within the storage constraints (target: < 150 MB)\n",
        "3. ✅ Maintain accuracy above 95% (city requirement)\n",
        "4. ✅ Achieve inference time under 50ms per image on CPU\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Toolkit:**  \n",
        "Your team lead suggests a three-stage optimization pipeline:\n",
        "- **Stage 1: Pruning** - Remove redundant weights to reduce model size\n",
        "- **Stage 2: Dynamic Quantization** - Convert heavy layers to INT8 for faster CPU inference  \n",
        "- **Stage 3: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** - Fine-tune with quantization simulation for maximum accuracy retention\n",
        "\n",
        "**Success Criteria:**  \n",
        "If you succeed, Metro City will expand the contract to 50 other cities nationwide, making CleanVision AI a leader in urban tech solutions. The CFO is counting on you—let's make this model deployment-ready!\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "You have already trained many models; now it is time to shape one for life outside a notebook. This lab guides you through taking a pre-trained ResNet-18 based StreetClassifier and turning it into a version that is easier to store, faster on CPU, and ready for deployment on edge targets. Along the way you will practice saving and reloading model state, pruning parameters, applying quantization, and evaluating the trade offs among accuracy, latency, and size.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load the CleanStreetDataset, initialize a pre-trained StreetClassifier, and establish a baseline evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Work with checkpoints by saving and restoring state_dict objects for both training and inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Implement magnitude-based pruning across convolutional and linear layers, with options for unstructured and structured strategies, and verify sparsity and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Apply dynamic quantization to linear layers for a fast CPU speedup and benchmark the effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Fuse common layer patterns and prepare a quantization-aware variant, fine-tune briefly, then convert to an INT8 model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compare accuracy, inference time, and file size before and after compression to understand the impact of each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you will have a compact classifier that keeps performance close to the original while being far more efficient to run and ship—ready for deployment on Metro City's fleet!"

        "3. **Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)** *(covered in Exercise 4)*: Simulates quantization effects **during training** using \"fake quantization\" so the model learns INT8-friendly weights. Provides the best accuracy retention but requires retraining/fine-tuning.  \n",

But I just got off the phone with Metro City's technical team—they're concerned about accuracy degradation on edge devices. This is where QAT (Quantization-Aware Training) comes in. By fine-tuning the model with fake-quantization during training, we can recover most of the accuracy loss while keeping all the speed and size benefits. This is our final optimization step before the demo!\"*\n",

        "\n",
        "**Your Results:**\n",
        "- ✅ **Model Size:** Reduced from 512 MB → 128 MB (75% reduction) - Well under the 150 MB target!\n",
        "- ✅ **CPU Inference Speed:** Improved by 44.2% - Now running in acceptable real-time\n",
        "- ✅ **Accuracy:** Maintained at ~96% - Above the city's 95% requirement\n",
        "- ✅ **Deployment-Ready:** Model now runs efficiently on CPU-only edge devices\n",

        "**What You Learned:**\n",
        "\n",
        "By saving and reloading state dictionaries, you protected your progress and created a repeatable path back to working models. With **pruning**, you explored how zeroing less useful parameters can make a network leaner, and you saw how masks change behavior without immediately changing tensor shapes. **Dynamic quantization** gave you a rapid path to smaller weights and faster CPU inference, and the **fusion plus quantization-aware training** workflow helped you fine-tune under simulated INT8 effects so the final converted model holds onto accuracy while gaining speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimized StreetClassifier is now:\n",
        "- Lighter and faster for edge deployment\n",
        "- Easier to package and distribute across Metro City's fleet\n",
        "- Ready for the city council demo next week!\n",
        "\n",
        "Thanks to your work, CleanVision AI is positioned to secure the nationwide expansion contract. The same workflow you mastered scales to larger architectures and different tasks: prune with intent, quantify the accuracy and latency impact, and then use quantization-aware training when you want the best balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps for Your Career:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you've mastered deployment optimization, consider:\n",
        "- Automating experiment tracking for reproducible results\n",
        "- Exploring structured pruning with channel removal to alter layer shapes\n",
        "- Exporting to formats like ONNX or TorchScript for even broader hardware compatibility\n",
        "- Deploying models to real edge devices (Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, mobile phones)\n",
