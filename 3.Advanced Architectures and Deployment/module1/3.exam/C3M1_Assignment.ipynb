    "# Programming Assignment: Classification and Visual Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on reaching the assignment of this module! You've journeyed through the concepts of custom architectures, exploring how designs like ResNet use skip connections for deeper training, DenseNet maximizes feature reuse through concatenation, and Siamese Networks learn powerful similarity functions. You've also seen the fundamental importance of **modular design**, building reusable `nn.Module` components, to manage complexity and enable flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to put all these principles into practice in a real-world scenario. Step into the role of an AI engineer at a leading online fashion retailer. Your task is to build the core AI engine for an intelligent product catalog system. This involves creating two distinct but related capabilities: accurately **classifying** clothing items and powering a **visual search** engine for recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment challenges you to think like a professional engineer, focusing on **efficiency** and **reusability**. You won't just build models; you'll architect them using custom, modular blocks inspired by modern efficient networks. You'll see how a well-designed feature extractor can be leveraged for multiple downstream tasks, a common and powerful pattern in applied deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this programming assignment, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement the `InvertedResidualBlock`, the efficient core component inspired by MobileNetV2, practicing custom module creation.\n",
    "* Construct a `MobileNetBackbone` by stacking your custom blocks, demonstrating modular network assembly.\n",
    "* Build and train a `MobileNetLikeClassifier` using the backbone for multi-class fashion item categorization, applying techniques like weighted loss for imbalance.\n",
    "* Design a `TripleDataset` to generate anchor, positive, and negative examples, setting the stage for similarity learning.\n",
    "* Engineer a `SiameseEncoder` by **reusing** the trained backbone from your classifier, showcasing architectural flexibility.\n",
    "* Assemble and train a `SiameseNetwork` using `TripletMarginLoss` to create a meaningful embedding space for visual similarity.\n",
    "* Apply your trained Siamese network to perform visual search, retrieving similar fashion items from a catalog based on image embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start building this intelligent fashion catalog engine!"

    "\n",
    "With your data pipeline ready, it's time to design the engine that will learn to classify the fashion items. For the online retailer, efficiency is key. The model might eventually run on various devices, possibly even directly within a mobile app. This calls for an architecture that balances accuracy with computational cost.\n",

    "Unlike the residual blocks you might have seen in ResNet (which typically have a wide -> narrow -> wide structure in terms of channels), the inverted residual block uses a narrow -> wide -> narrow approach. It first expands the input channels using a computationally inexpensive 1x1 convolution, then applies a lightweight **depthwise separable convolution** for spatial feature extraction in the expanded space, and finally projects the features back down to a lower dimension with another 1x1 convolution. A skip connection, similar to ResNet, is also used to help with gradient flow. This design significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations compared to standard convolutional blocks, making the model faster and more memory efficient.\n",

    "Unlike standard classification where the model learns from single images and labels, a Siamese Network learns from **comparisons**. To teach it which fashion items are visually similar (belonging to the same category, in this simplified case) and which are dissimilar, you need to provide examples in a specific format: **triplets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each triplet consists of three images:\n",
    "1.  **Anchor:** An image of a fashion item (e.g., a specific t-shirt).\n",
    "2.  **Positive:** *Another* image from the **same category** as the anchor (e.g., a different t-shirt).\n",
    "3.  **Negative:** An image from a **different category** than the anchor (e.g., a pair of pants).\n",
    "\n",
    "By training on these triplets, the model learns to pull the anchor and positive embeddings closer together in the embedding space, while pushing the anchor and negative embeddings further apart. This process sculpts the embedding space, making it meaningful for visual search.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fantastic work completing this assignment and concluding Module 1! You've successfully applied advanced PyTorch concepts to build a sophisticated, dual-purpose AI system for a realistic e-commerce scenario. By acting as an AI engineer, you've moved beyond simple sequential models and embraced the power of custom, modular architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "You began by constructing an efficient classifier, mastering the implementation of the `InvertedResidualBlock` and assembling it into a `MobileNetBackbone`. Then, showcasing true engineering resourcefulness, you seamlessly repurposed that trained backbone to create a `SiameseEncoder`. You adeptly handled the shift to similarity learning by designing a `TripleDataset` and training a `SiameseNetwork` with `TripletMarginLoss`, effectively sculpting an embedding space where visual similarity translates to proximity. Finally, you brought it all together by implementing a practical visual search function, demonstrating how these embeddings can power features like product recommendations or \"shop the look\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment solidified key principles from the module: the importance of **modular design** for flexibility and reuse, the ability to implement **custom blocks** and architectures beyond simple sequences, and the distinct approaches required for **classification versus similarity learning**. The skills you've honed here, designing efficient blocks, reusing components, and adapting models for different objectives, are directly applicable to building state-of-the-art AI systems in many professional domains. Well done on building this intelligent fashion engine!"
