        "In this notebook, you'll explore a series of hands-on steps that build your understanding of how vision models process, interpret, and even create images. You'll start by examining how convolutional layers capture local features and progressively integrate them into more abstract representations as the receptive field expands. From there, you'll investigate ways to uncover what parts of an image most influence a model's predictions, and finally, you'll move into methods that generate entirely new images from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "By working through the exercises, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Analyze how feature maps evolve through deeper convolutional layers and how receptive fields grow.\n",
        "- Apply pixel-level interpretability with saliency maps to highlight influential image areas.\n",
        "- Use region-focused techniques like Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to visualize high-level feature importance.\n",
        "- Experiment with generative approaches such as diffusion models to transform noise into coherent images.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Focus of Attention**: Bright regions indicate pixels that strongly influence the model's prediction for the target class. For a \"rotten\" classification, you should see highlights on damaged or discolored areas of the fruit.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Expected Behavior**: A well-trained model should highlight relevant features (e.g., brown spots, mold, holes) rather than background or irrelevant texture. If the saliency focuses on the background, the model might be using spurious correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Noise vs. Signal**: Saliency maps can be noisy—you'll often see scattered bright pixels. The overall pattern matters more than individual pixels. Look for coherent regions rather than random noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Complementary to CAM**: Saliency maps show pixel-level sensitivity (fine-grained), while CAM shows region-level importance (coarse-grained). Use both together for complete understanding—saliency tells you *exactly which pixels*, CAM tells you *which general areas*.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Limitations**: \n",
        "   - Saliency maps show sensitivity, not necessarily causation\n",
        "   - Different classes may produce different patterns for the same image\n",
        "   - Sharp edges often appear salient even if not semantically important\n",

The original CAM technique relies on this specific architecture pattern. For models with different architectures, **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a more general approach that uses gradients instead of direct weight mapping and works with any CNN architecture. Both techniques produce similar visualizations, but Grad-CAM is more flexible and doesn't require the GAP→FC pattern.\n",

        "You have traced the journey of an image through different stages — from being transformed into layered feature representations, to revealing which parts of it shaped the model’s decision, and finally to generating entirely new visuals guided by patterns the model has learned. Along the way, you used tools that operate at different scales, from fine-grained pixel sensitivity to broader region-level focus, and eventually to structured creation of images from random noise. These skills give you a balanced toolkit: one that not only helps you interpret and refine models, but also lets you apply them in creative and purposeful ways.\n"
