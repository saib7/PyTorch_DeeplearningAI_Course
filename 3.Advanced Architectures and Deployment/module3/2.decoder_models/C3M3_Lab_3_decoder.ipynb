    "# Understanding and Building Decoder Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll explore **decoder models** - the generative half of the transformer architecture that powers language generation systems like GPT, ChatGPT, and other autoregressive models. While the previous notebooks covered attention mechanisms and encoders (which understand and represent text), this notebook focuses on decoders, which **generate text one token at a time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Decoder?\n",
    "\n",
    "A decoder is a neural network architecture designed to generate sequences autoregressively - meaning it produces output tokens one by one, where each new token depends on all previously generated tokens. Think of it like autocomplete on steroids: given a starting prompt, the decoder predicts what comes next, then uses that prediction to predict what comes after that, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight that makes decoders powerful is their use of **self-attention with causal masking**. This allows them to:\n",
    "- Consider all previous context when generating the next token\n",
    "- Learn complex patterns and dependencies in sequential data\n",
    "- Generate coherent, contextually appropriate text\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll construct a complete decoder model and train it to generate Shakespeare-style poetry. You'll see firsthand how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Causal masking** ensures the model only looks at past tokens (no \"cheating\" by seeing the future)\n",
    "2. **Multi-layer architecture** builds increasingly sophisticated representations of text\n",
    "3. **Training progression** transforms random output into coherent Shakespeare-inspired verse\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have built the same fundamental architecture that, when scaled up, becomes GPT-3, GPT-4, and other state-of-the-art language models. The difference between your Shakespeare generator and ChatGPT is mainly scale - more data, more parameters, and more compute - but the core architecture remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing with Previous Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds directly on what you've learned:\n",
    "- **Attention Notebook**: You learned how attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant information\n",
    "- **Encoder Notebook**: You built models that understand and represent input text\n",
    "- **This Decoder Notebook**: You'll build models that generate text, combining attention with autoregressive generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The improvement you'll observe from a simple attention model to a full decoder architecture will demonstrate why modern language models use this specific design."

    "## 2. What is a Decoder?\n",
    "\n",
    "A decoder is a neural network architecture designed for **sequence generation**. Unlike encoders that process entire sequences bidirectionally to create representations, decoders generate outputs autoregressively - one token at a time, using only information from previous positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that decoders are fundamentally predictive: at each position, they predict what comes next based on what came before. This makes them perfect for tasks like text generation, code completion, and conversational AI.\n",

    "The autoregressive nature of decoders means they generate text word by word, where each new prediction becomes part of the input for generating the next token. This sequential generation process is what allows decoders to maintain coherence across long sequences."

    "## 3. Decoder from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "A decoder consists of several key components that work together to generate sequences. You'll implement each component following the transformer architecture pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causal Masking\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal mask is crucial for decoder training. It ensures that when predicting a token at position `i`, the model can only see tokens at positions `0` to `i-1`, not future tokens. This prevents \"cheating\" during training - the model learns to predict based only on past context, just like it will have to do during generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when processing \"The cat sat\", at position 2 (word \"sat\"), the model can see \"The\" and \"cat\" but not \"sat\" itself. This mask is a matrix where allowed connections are 0 and blocked connections are -infinity (which become 0 after softmax).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Example for size=4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Causal mask (True = blocked, False = allowed):\n",
    "\n",
    "Position:     0    1    2    3\n",
    "           ┌────┬────┬────┬────┐\n",

    "        1  │ F  │ F  │ T  │ T  │  → At position 1, can see positions 0-1\n",
    "           ├────┼────┼────┼────┤\n",
    "        2  │ F  │ F  │ F  │ T  │  → At position 2, can see positions 0-2\n",
    "           ├────┼────┼────┼────┤\n",

    "\n",
    "F = False (can attend)\n",
    "T = True (masked/blocked)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the decoder sees the entire target sequence at once for efficiency. Without masking, it could cheat:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Target sequence: ['<sos>', 'Hello', 'world', '<eos>']\n",
    "\n",
    "Without mask (WRONG):\n",

    "- This doesn't match inference where it only has previously generated tokens\n",
    "\n",

    "- When predicting 'Hello', decoder can only see '<sos>'\n",

    "### 3.2 Positional Encoding in the Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the encoder, the decoder needs positional encoding to understand word order. Without it, the attention mechanism would treat \"The cat chased the dog\" and \"The dog chased the cat\" as identical bags of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decoder-Specific Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the decoder uses the same sinusoidal positional encoding you've already seen in the encoder, its role here is even more critical:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generation Order Matters**: During text generation, the decoder produces tokens one at a time. Positional encoding helps it track where it is in the output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Attention Alignment**: When the decoder attends to encoder outputs (cross-attention), positional information helps align source and target positions correctly. For example, in translation, word order often changes between languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining Causality**: Combined with causal masking, positional encoding ensures the decoder respects the sequential nature of language generation - position 5 can't accidentally influence position 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation remains the same - you add sinusoidal patterns to embeddings based on position, giving each token a unique \"position signature\" that the model uses to understand sequence structure. This positional information flows through all attention layers, helping the decoder maintain coherent sequential output generation."

    "In this lab, you built a complete decoder model from scratch with causal masking and positional encoding, then trained it to generate Shakespeare-style text using next-token prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Decoders Excel at Text Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal Masking**: Unlike simple attention that sees all positions, decoders enforce left-to-right generation by masking future tokens - exactly how text is naturally written.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Layer Architecture**: Stacked decoder layers (vs single attention) learn hierarchical patterns from characters → words → phrases → sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose-Built Design**: Decoders are explicitly optimized for next-token prediction, while simple attention was designed for understanding/encoding, not generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**: \n",
    "- Simple attention: ~60-70% coherent text\n",
    "- Decoder: ~85-95% coherent text with maintained style\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder's specialized architecture for sequential generation makes it the foundation of modern language models like GPT, significantly outperforming attention-only approaches for text generation tasks."
