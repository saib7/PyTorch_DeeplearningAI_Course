        "\n",
        "The encoder-decoder architecture is a powerful framework for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks. It consists of two main components working in tandem:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Encoder**: Processes the entire input sequence and creates a rich representation (context) of it\n",
        "2. **The Decoder**: Takes this context and generates the output sequence step by step\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as a two-stage translation process:\n",
        "- First, the encoder \"understands\" the source sentence completely\n",
        "- Then, the decoder \"expresses\" this understanding in the target language\n",
        "\n",
        "<a id='1-1'></a>\n",
        "### 1.1 How Encoder-Decoder Models Work\n",
        "\n",
        "The encoder-decoder architecture follows these key principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding Phase**: The encoder processes the entire input sequence (e.g., an English sentence) and produces a sequence of hidden states that capture the meaning and context of each word in relation to the entire sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Context Passing**: The encoder's output (hidden states) is passed to the decoder as context. In transformer models, this happens through cross-attention mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Decoding Phase**: The decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time, using:\n",
        "   - The encoder's context (through cross-attention)\n",
        "   - Previously generated tokens (through self-attention)\n",
        "   - Learned patterns from training data\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Autoregressive Generation**: During inference, the decoder generates tokens sequentially, where each new token depends on all previously generated tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "<a id='1-2'></a>\n",
        "### 1.2 Key Components and Information Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "The information flow in an encoder-decoder transformer can be visualized as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Input Sequence → Encoder → Context Vectors → Decoder → Output Sequence\n",
        "     (English)              (Hidden States)              (Desired language)\n",

        "Each component plays a crucial role:\n",

        "- **Decoder Self-Attention**: Ensures coherence in the generated target sequence\n",

        "In this exercise, you'll build the **Encoder** component of our translation model. The encoder is responsible for reading and understanding the source language (English in our case) and creating a rich contextual representation that captures the meaning of the entire sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What You'll Build:\n",
        "\n",
        "The encoder processes source sentences through the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Token Embedding**: Convert word indices to dense vectors\n",
        "2. **Positional Encoding**: Add position information (since transformers don't inherently understand word order)\n",
        "3. **Transformer Encoding**: Apply self-attention to understand relationships between all words in the source sentence\n",
        "4. **Output Memory**: Generate contextualized representations that the decoder will use for translation\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts to Remember:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Padding Index**: We use index 0 for padding tokens (to handle variable-length sentences)\n",
        "- **Batch First**: We set `batch_first=True` to keep dimensions intuitive `[batch_size, seq_len, d_model]`\n",
        "- **Memory**: The encoder output is called \"memory\" because the decoder will repeatedly reference it during translation\n",

        "#### Expected Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "After completing this exercise, your encoder should:\n",

        "Now that you've trained your encoder-decoder model, it's time to see it in action! In this section, you'll implement a translation function that takes an English sentence and generates its translation in your target language.\n",

        "### How Translation Generation Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike training (where you have the complete target sequence), during inference you need to generate the translation token by token. This process is called **autoregressive generation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start with `<sos>`**: Begin the target sequence with the start-of-sequence token\n",
        "2. **Generate one token at a time**: Feed the current partial translation to the decoder\n",
        "3. **Select the next word**: Choose the most likely next token from the model's predictions\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Add the predicted token to the sequence and continue\n",
        "5. **Stop at `<eos>`**: End generation when the model predicts the end-of-sequence token\n",
        "\n",
        "### Greedy Decoding\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation below uses **greedy decoding** - at each step, you simply choose the token with the highest probability. While this doesn't always produce the best translation (beam search would be better), it's simple and effective for demonstration purposes.\n",

        "Great job completing this assignment! You've successfully built a complete encoder-decoder transformer architecture for machine translation from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What You Built\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this assignment, you implemented:\n",
        "\n",
        "- An encoder that processes and understands source language sentences\n",
        "- A decoder that generates translations in the target language  \n",
        "- The complete translation system that combines both components\n",
        "- A training pipeline that teaches the model to translate between languages\n",
        "- An inference system that generates translations for new sentences\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts You've Mastered\n",
        "\n",
        "By completing this implementation, you now understand:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How encoders create contextualized representations of input text\n",
        "2. How decoders generate output sequences using cross-attention to the encoder\n",
        "3. The role of attention masks in handling variable-length sequences and preventing information leakage\n",
        "4. The difference between training (with teacher forcing) and inference (autoregressive generation)\n",
        "5. How positional encodings give transformers awareness of word order\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "The architecture you built forms the foundation of modern machine translation systems and many other NLP applications. This encoder-decoder pattern appears in tasks ranging from text summarization to question answering. The hands-on experience you've gained implementing these components from scratch gives you deep insight into how state-of-the-art NLP models actually work."
